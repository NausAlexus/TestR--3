            <h3 class="responsible-gaming-subtitle">1. Understanding Skill in Gaming</h3>
            <p class="responsible-gaming-content">
                Rummy is fundamentally a game of skill that necessitates analytical thinking, strategic planning, and concentration. Unlike games based purely on chance, your success with Rummy is contingent upon how adeptly you make informed choices, adapt your strategies, and enhance your gameplay over time.
            </p>
        
            <h3 class="responsible-gaming-subtitle">2. Guidelines for Responsible Play</h3>

                To ensure a balanced and fulfilling experience, we recommend that players adopt the following responsible gaming principles:
            </p>
            <ul class="responsible-gaming-list">
                <li>Focus on strategic gameplay and skill enhancement.</li>
                <li>Establish time limits to maintain a healthy balance between gaming and other activities.</li>
                <li>Avoid hasty decisions; take time to assess the game thoughtfully.</li>
                <li>Participate in friendly competition while showing respect toward fellow players.</li>
            </ul>
